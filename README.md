ViewBuilder is still in development. The idea is to be able to quickly build a json ready page using just a few calls to the pieces script. The only website currently using this is ThermokWeb.

You can find a more simplified version of the thermok website in the examples folder.

This was originally created to work with views, but it is easily extended by creating a json php file for whatever deviceType you want to build a page for.
